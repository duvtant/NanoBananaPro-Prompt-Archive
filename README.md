# 🍌 NB2Pro-Promptbook (Nano Banana 2 Pro Image Archive)

**The ultimate community-driven archive for the Nano Banana 2 Pro (Gemini 3 Pro Image) model.**

---

## 🌟 Overview

Welcome to the **NB2Pro-Promptbook**! This repository is a curated public collection of high-quality images generated by the **Nano Banana 2 Pro** model (powered by Google's cutting-edge **Gemini 3 Pro Image** technology) along with the exact text prompts used to create them.

The goal is to serve as a valuable resource for prompt engineering, artistic inspiration, and studying the model's capabilities, especially concerning **high-resolution output (4K)** and **character consistency**.

## 🚀 Why Nano Banana 2 Pro?

Nano Banana 2 Pro is Google's flagship image generation model, known for:

* **State-of-the-Art Consistency:** Excels at maintaining the same character or style across multiple generations.
* **High Fidelity:** Native support for high-resolution images (up to 4K).
* **Text & Reasoning:** Exceptional at rendering legible text within images and adhering to complex instructions (thanks to the Gemini 3 Pro core).

## 🗂️ Repository Structure

Images and prompts are organized into folders based on category for easy browsing:
├── prompts-and-images │ ├── /Character-Consistency │ ├── /High-Res-4K │ ├── /Complex-Scenes │ ├── /Stylized-Art │ └── /... and more! ├── README.md └── LICENSE


Each submission will include:
1.  The generated image file (e.g., `image-name.png`).
2.  A text file containing the **full prompt** and any **negative prompts** used (e.g., `image-name.txt`).
3.  Metadata (aspect ratio, resolution, etc.) where available.
